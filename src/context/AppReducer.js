//An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If youâ€™re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)
export default (state, action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
      case 'DELETE_TRANSACTION':
        return {
          ...state,
          transactions: state.transactions.filter((transaction) => transaction.id != action.payload)
        }
      case 'ADD_TRANSACTION':

          transactions: [action.payload,...state.transactions]
